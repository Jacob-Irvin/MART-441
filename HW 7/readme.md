I think I am on the right track but I had a pretty tough go this week. I think it was just the amount of new information we covered. I always feel conident when going through the lesson and watching the videos but actually putting the material into practice myself seems to be a bit of a challenge. I do think that after this week I definetly have a better understanding of classes and objects. I just need to keep practicing as we move along.
