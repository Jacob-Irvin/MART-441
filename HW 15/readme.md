My experience with node went pretty well. I can surely understand why it is such a powerful and necessary tool. I had better luck getting everything to run on the online version of node.js my first time through the lesson before I actually downloaded it to my computer. I just kept getting errors on my terminal saying that the folders couldn't be found, but I just followed along to the videos anyway and I think I now have a decent understanding of what node can do and why so many people utalize it. I think it fits into everything else we have done this semester because it is compatible with everything we've learned and does so much in the background that saves people lots of time and work.
