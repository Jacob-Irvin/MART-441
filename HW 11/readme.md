I had fun with this lesson, I think HTML5 could be very useful. I was having no trouble during the lesson while following along to the videos and everything was working fine but I could not get the movement to work with the homework, neither user controlled or autonomous. I am not sure what I am missing but it was working fine for me during the practices so I was a little confused. I think I was on the right track for setting up the collisions but I was unavle to test it because I couldn't get the movement figured out. Either way I was able get my canvas and shapes set up as well as the audio file at least.
