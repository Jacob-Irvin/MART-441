I think I understand how things were supposed to work for this week but I did struggle actually applying them once it came to the homework. I knew what I needed to do but it was just a matter of figuring out how to connect it all together. I think i still have some work to do before im super comfortable with everything that was covered this week but im hoping as we go along more of it will start to click. I was able to overcome most of my struggles with the help of my very kind professor who was willing to email me back and help pretty late at night, which I really appreacited.
