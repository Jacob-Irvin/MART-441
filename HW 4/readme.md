I struggled with this week a little more than I have in the previous few weeks. I think I have a decent understanding of how things are supposed to work and why they do what they do but it is just sort of a matter of putting everything together now. I took the assigment this week as far as I could but I had trouble getting any of the next choices to be called after the first couple. Regardless, I am looking forward to future assignments so I can maybe come back to this one after I have a solid understanding of why I couldnt get it to work.
