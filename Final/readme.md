I enjoyed this final project and for the most part I was able to create something kind of cool using HTML5 canvas. I watched a lot of tutorials and did some reading to better my basic understanding of HTML5 and through that and a lot of trial and error I was able to get my digital "coloring book" to work. I had a lot of ups and downs throughout the semester in this class but I learned a lot and overall really enjoyed it. Im hoping to get some more experience with coding under my belt in the near future, thanks for a great semester.
