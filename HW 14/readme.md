I was able to create the shapes on one page, and a design I created with lines on another. But when I tried to implement them together it screwed up both the shapes and the lines and I am not sure why. It was the same for the models. I kept them on seperate pages just to show that they worked by themselves before trying to add them to the same page. I think that three.js can be an amazing tool once I get it down but I struggled a little bit with it this week. Github also wouldn't allow me to upload the three.js folder because it was too large.
